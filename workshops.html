								<h2>Neurotraining Integration for Sports Teams </h2>
								<p> These group workshops are designed for sports teams and movement collectives — regardless of discipline — who want to integrate neurocentric methods into their regular training. Whether you're in dance, martial arts, athletics, or team sports, the training is tailored to your field.

									I will guide your group through targeted sessions that develop e.g. vision, balance, proprioception or interoception.

									This format is particularly well-suited for training camps, intensives, and focused group sessions, where there's time and space to dive deep and implement new tools effectively.

									The goal: faster reactions, more precise movement, fewer injuries, and better overall performance.
									<br><br>
									<b>This isn't just an add-on — it's a smart upgrade to how you train. Let's bring brain-based training into your sport.</b>

                                <h2>Neurocentric Training for Coaches</h2>
								<p>
									I offer tailored support for sports teams/ movement coaches and their staff who want to integrate brain-based training tools into their regular routines — without overhauling their existing training plans.

									By focusing on the nervous system — the control center of every movement — we can enhance athletic performance from the inside out. Through targeted assessments and practical tools, I work closely with coaches and trainers to help them implement neurocentric methods that align with their sport-specific goals and structure.

									We’re not here to replace your current training system, but to complement it with, effective neuroathletic tools that can improve for example vision, balance, coordination, and reaction speed. This approach also plays a key role in injury prevention, boosting movement quality, and joint control.

									Teams receive ready-to-use drills and systems that integrate smoothly into existing plans. The result: more focused athletes, better decision-making under pressure, fewer injuries, and a lasting performance edge.

                                <h2>Talks & Lectures – Understanding the Nervous System and Neuroathletic Training</h2>
								<p>

                                    In my talks, I provide a clear and accessible introduction to the fascinating world of the nervous system and how it shapes everything we do—from movement and performance to focus and recovery.

                                            Audiences will gain insight into how the brain, eyes, balance system, and body communicate—and why this connection is critical for athletes, creatives, and everyday movers alike. I break down the core principles of Neuroathletiktraining, showing how targeted, brain-based interventions can unlock new levels of coordination, resilience, and injury prevention.

                                            Whether for sports clubs, professional groups, educational institutions, or wellness events, these talks are informative, practical, and designed to inspire a new perspective on performance and training.

                                            Ideal for coaches, therapists, athletes, and anyone curious about how the brain drives the body.</p>
