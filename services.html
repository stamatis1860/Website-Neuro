								<h2>Free 20 Minute Call</h2>
								<p>Curious about how Neuro Athletic Training (NAT) can support your unique goals? Whether you're dealing with chronic pain, recovering from injury, seeking better movement, or simply looking to enhance your performance, this call is your chance to connect with me directly.

									In this free 20-minute call, you’ll get the opportunity to:

										<ul>
											<li>Ask any questions you have about NAT</li>
											<li>Learn how I approach pain, performance, and nervous system retraining</li>
											<li>Share your goals, challenges, or concerns—no matter where you're starting from</li>
											<li>Explore a personalized strategy to help you move forward confidently</li>
										</ul>

									My goal is to make sure you feel heard, understood, and supported—with clear next steps.
									All sessions are held online via Google Meet.
									</p>

								<h2>Small Neuroassessment</h2>
								<p>The Neuroassessment is a detailed, science-based evaluation designed to uncover how your nervous system is functioning—and where it may need support. This session combines well-established tests from clinical neurology to give us a clear picture of your brain-body connection.

								During the assessment, I will evaluate key neurological systems using proven methods, including:
								
								<ul>

									<li>Vital signs – blood pressure, heart rate, and other baseline indicators</li>

									<li>Breathing patterns – to assess regulation, rhythm, and nervous system tone</li>

									<li>Gait analysis – how you walk provides insights into coordination and brain function</li>

									<li>Sensory testing – checking how your nervous system processes touch, temperature, and proprioception</li>

									<li>Cerebellar tests – to examine balance, motor control, and coordination</li>

									<li>Cranial nerve examination – assessing all 12 cranial nerves that control essential functions like eye movement, facial sensation, hearing, and more</li>

									<li>Visual testing – looking at visual tracking, stability, and processing</li>

								</ul>

								These tests are widely used in neurological practice and give us valuable information about how your brain and nervous system are communicating with your body.
								This assessment allows us to pinpoint specific areas of dysfunction or imbalance, even if symptoms are barely visible in everyday life we have to approach them as fast as posible so they dont get worse. From there, we can design a targeted, personalized plan using Neuro Athletic Training (NAT) or other appropriate methods to help you move better, feel better, and regain control over your health and performance.</p>

								<h2>Personaltraining</h2>
								<p>This is not just traditional personal training—it's training guided by your nervous system. Whether you're looking to build strength, improve mobility, recover from injury, or enhance performance, this approach starts with understanding how your brain and body work together.

									Unlike a full neurological assessment, your first session includes a goal-specific evaluation. We only perform the tests that are directly relevant to your needs and training goals. This may include:

										Movement and mobility screening

										Functional strength testing

										Targeted neurological assessments (e.g., balance, vision, reflexes, coordination)

										Breathing evaluation

										Sensory or motor control checks where needed

									This focused assessment allows us to gather meaningful information without overwhelming you with unnecessary testing. Based on the results, we’ll build a personalized training or rehab plan using a neurocentric approach—where every drill or exercise is selected to create better communication between your brain and body.</p>
