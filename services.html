								<h2>Free 20 Minute Call</h2>
								<p>Curious about how Neuro Athletic Training (NAT) can support your unique goals? Whether you're dealing with chronic pain, recovering from injury, seeking better movement, or simply looking to enhance your performance, this call is your chance to connect with me directly.

									In this free 20-minute call, you’ll get the opportunity to:

										<ul>
											<li>Ask any questions you have about NAT</li>
											<li>Learn how I approach pain, performance, and nervous system retraining</li>
											<li>Share your goals, challenges, or concerns—no matter where you're starting from</li>

								<h2>Small Neuroassessment</h2>
								<p>The Neuroassessment is a detailed, science-based evaluation designed to uncover how your nervous system is functioning—and where it may need support. This session combines well-established tests from clinical neurology to give us a clear picture of your brain-body connection.

								During the assessment, I will evaluate key neurological systems using proven methods, including:
								
								<ul>

									<li><strong>Vital signs</strong> – blood pressure, heart rate, and other baseline indicators</li>

									<li><strong>Breathing patterns</strong> – to assess regulation, rhythm, and nervous system tone</li>

									<li><strong>Gait analysis</strong> – how you walk provides insights into coordination and brain function</li>

									<li><strong>Sensory testing</strong> – checking how your nervous system processes touch, temperature, and proprioception</li>

									<li><strong>Cerebellar tests</strong> – to examine balance, motor control, and coordination</li>

									<li><strong>Cranial nerve examination</strong> – assessing all 12 cranial nerves that control essential functions like eye movement, facial sensation, hearing, and more</li>

									<li><strong>Visual testing</strong> – looking at visual tracking, fixation, and processing</li>

								</ul>

								These tests are widely recognized in neurological practice and provide valuable insights into how effectively your brain and nervous system is functioning. They help us identify subtle dysfunctions or imbalances—often before they become noticeable in daily life.

By detecting these issues early on, we can take proactive steps to prevent them from worsening. Based on your results, we’ll develop a personalized, targeted plan to help you move more efficiently, feel better, and take back control of your health and performance.</p>
								<h2>Full Neuroassessment</h2>

								<h2>Personaltraining</h2>
								<p>

									Unlike the Neurossessment, your first session focuses on a goal-specific evaluation that begins with an in-depth discussion of your history and training or rehabilitation goals. Based on this, we perform only the tests most relevant to your individual needs.

									What sets this session apart is that we don’t just assess—we start right away. You'll begin with targeted exercises and immediate adjustments to your current training or rehab plan. Together, we’ll review your existing program and explore how a neurocentric approach can be integrated to enhance your performance and results.

									Whether we create a new personalized plan or build on what you're already doing, every exercise will be chosen to improve the communication between your brain and body—helping you move, perform, and recover more effectively.</p>
