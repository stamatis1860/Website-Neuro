									<h2> Neuroathletik Group Workshops – Sharpen the Brain, Elevate Performance</h2>
									<p>
These group workshops offer a powerful introduction to neurocentric training for teams, clubs, and groups across disciplines. By focusing on the brain and nervous system as the control center of movement, Neuroathletiktraining helps participants improve coordination, reaction time, focus, and overall movement efficiency.

In a team setting—whether in sports, dance, or performance—this approach builds a shared foundation of body awareness, mental clarity, and injury prevention. For sports teams in particular, the benefits are immediate and measurable: faster decision-making, better on-field communication, quicker recovery, and more resilient athletes.

Each workshop is tailored to the specific demands of the group, combining theory with hands-on practice. Participants leave with a deeper understanding of their own nervous system—and tools they can apply in training and competition.

Perfect for sports teams, performance groups, dance ensembles, and anyone looking to level up through smarter training.</p>

									<h2>Diving into Arts / Workshops for Creativity, Productivity & Relaxation – Brain-Based Tools for Modern Life</h2>
									<p>
										In these workshops, I guide teams, creatives, and individuals through practical, neuroscience-based tools that help unlock creativity, improve focus, and reduce stress. Whether in a retreat setting or a corporate environment, participants learn how their nervous system influences performance, communication, and well-being—and how to work with it, not against it.

										Using insights from Neuroathletic Training and movement science, these sessions combine theory with direct experience to create lasting impact. From simple breathing techniques and sensory drills to movement-based practices, the tools are easy to apply in everyday life and work.

										Ideal for teams seeking innovation, creatives looking for flow, or anyone wanting more clarity and balance in their day-to-day routines.</p>

												Hi, I'm [Your Name], a sports scientist and certified Neuroathletic Trainer with a deep passion for the brain-body connection. My journey into neuroscience began with the Feldenkrais Method, which opened my eyes to how movement and awareness shape performance, healing, and creativity.

												After completing my Bachelor's degree in Sport Science, I dove into the world of neuroathletics—fascinated by how targeted brain-based training can unlock new levels of physical and mental potential. I now integrate this approach not only in performance and rehab settings but also in my own artistic work as a dancer and creative.

												I'm active in triathlon, tennis, calisthenics—really, anything that challenges my body and mind. Above all, I love to dance. I run a small dance school focused on Brazilian Zouk, and I truly believe that dancing is one of the best things you can do for your body and your brain.

												Whether in training, therapy, or the creative process, my goal is to help people move smarter, feel stronger, and live more fully—guided by the intelligence of the nervous system. If you want to get to know me better click on my peronal Instgram account </p>
